# CMPM-121-FALL

## Scene

My scene is set outside. Under the night sky, there are snow-capped mountains and broad plains. A little girl gazed out the window at the intriguing towering skyscraper not far away. The green Chinese-style old pavilion was connected by an arch bridge on the lake in front of the structure. The lake is exceptionally quiet, with the air sweeping through the long grass.

## Object 

The majority of the things were discovered on the Internet, and the specifics will be provided below. The most common are natural decorations such as trees, grass, and flowers. The majority of the intriguing old structures are searching for homes, bridges, and Chinese-style antique pavilions. Finally, the main character, ang girl, was discovered on the Internet. The majority of the resources are already available.

## Inspire

My inspiration comes from contemporary MMORPG map designs like CLX, Journey, Sky:Children of Light, and Genshin Impact. Furthermore, I am really interested in seeing Tibet and Chinese historical structures since these distinctive cultural buildings usually show a lengthy history and mystery, which inspires me to investigate. Personally, I believe most people's backs may offer a lot of tale sense. This scenario was made using these principles.

## Main Character

My main character is a young girlÂ with long white hair and a black gown who is staring at the antique structure with her back to the camera. demonstrating her link to the historic structure
