## Scene

My scene is set outside. Under the night sky, there are snow-capped mountains and broad plains. A little girl gazed out the window at the intriguing towering skyscraper not far away. The green Chinese-style old pavilion was connected by an arch bridge on the lake in front of the structure. The lake is exceptionally quiet, with the air sweeping through the long grass.

## Inspire

My inspiration comes from contemporary MMORPG map designs like CLX, Journey, Sky:Children of Light, and Genshin Impact. Furthermore, I am really interested in seeing Tibet and Chinese historical structures since these distinctive cultural buildings usually show a lengthy history and mystery, which inspires me to investigate. Personally, I believe most people's backs may offer a lot of tale sense. This scenario was made using these principles.

## Main Character

My main character is a young girlÂ with long white hair and a black gown who is staring at the antique structure with her back to the camera. demonstrating her link to the historic structure
